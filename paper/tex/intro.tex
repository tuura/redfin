Software bugs play a major role in the history of spacecraft
accidents~\cite{Leveson2004}. There are recorded cases of mission-ending bugs
that would have been difficult to prevent (e.g. caused by concurrency
or updates) but also plain integer overflows~\cite{bug-rocket} and incorrect unit
conversion~\cite{NASA:1999:Mars}, which should have been eradicated long ago.

Alas, there is no silver bullet. Testing is supported by mature methodologies
and frameworks, but does not provide the full correctness guarantee. General-purpose
strongly-typed languages can be used to eliminate important classes of bugs, but
are less familiar to software engineers and are often not suitable for highly
resource-constrained microarchitectures used in space electronics. Formal modelling
methods provide a systematic approach for developing complex systems in a
correct-by-construction manner, but they are still at the bleeding-edge of
computing science and can be difficult to apply to real-life systems. This paper
combines known formal verification and programming languages techniques and presents
a formal verification approach for simple control tasks, such as satellite power
management, which are executed on a real processing core used in space missions.
We believe the presented ideas are transferable to other domains with similar
safety and resource requirements, e.g. biomedical applications.

Fig.~\ref{fig-overview} shows an overview of the presented approach. The bottom
part corresponds to conventional code generation and simulation, where
REDFIN\footnote{REDFIN stands for `REDuced instruction set for Fixed-point \&
INteger arithmetic'. This instruction set and the corresponding processing core
were developed by RUAG Space Austria GmbH for space missions.
See~\S\ref{sec-redfin} for more details.} assembly language is executed by
simulating the effect of each instruction on the state of the processor and memory.
The corresponding \emph{state transformer} is typically implicit and intertwined
with the rest of the simulation infrastructure. The main idea of our approach is
to represent the state transformer explicitly so that it can be symbolically
manipulated and used not only for simulation but also for formal verification by
compiling it into an SMT formula. We can then~use~an~SMT solver, e.g.
Z3~\cite{de2008z3}, to verify that the state transformer of a given program
satisfies certain properties, for example, that integer overflow cannot occur
regardless of input parameters and that the program always terminates within
given time.

By embedding the state transformer metalanguage in Haskell we can readily
implement compilers from higher-level \emph{typed} languages to untyped assembly,
eradicating incorrect number and unit conversion bugs. As shown at the top of
Fig.~\ref{fig-overview}, engineers can write high-level control
programs for the REDFIN architecture directly in a small subset of Haskell. These
high-level programs can be used for type-safe code generation and as executable
specifications of intended functionality for the purposes of program synthesis and
equivalence checking. % (\S\ref{sec-verification}).

We first introduce the REDFIN processing core (\S\ref{sec-redfin}), and then
describe and discuss the presented approach
(\S\ref{sec-transformer}-\S\ref{sec-discussion}). Related work is reviewed
in~\S\ref{sec-related}.
