This paper presents a formal verification approach developed to tackle a real
engineering problem by combining known techniques from the formal verification
and programming languages research communities. We demonstrated that these
techniques can be applied to create a formal model of the spacecraft processing
core REDFIN that is used to execute small control programs, and showed how to
formally verify such programs. By releasing the state transformer semantics to
public, we hope to provide other researchers with a realistic benchmark for
their formal verification tools.
