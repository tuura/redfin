# Comments To Reviewers

## Referee 1

> References style should be changed to a numbered format.

Done

> Quality of Figure 3 needs improvement; Axis titles should be relocated.

The figure has been improved

> The table on page 16 requires a caption.

A caption for the table has been added

## Referee 2

>  However, I did not find the updated set of features for the REDFIN processing core in section 3, compared to the conference version. The authors should highlight such improvements as stated in this work.

The REDFIN processing core or the REDFIN instruction-set architecture
has not been changed, i.e. the set of features remains the same as
described in the section 2. The novel contribution of the extended
manuscript is the description of the reworked verification framework,
which now has support for both branching and merging symbolic
execution (section 3.3). The branching mode is essential for
verification of the loop invariant in the stepper-motor control program
case study, described in section 5.
